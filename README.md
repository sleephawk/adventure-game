# Adventure Game

## HTML

- [x] Create a container that includes elements for text, and a container to hold all elements
      (choice buttons will be created by DOM);
- [ ] Create game heading and start button

## Logic

- [ ] Query Selectors
  - [ ]

## API

From Vite we have a CSV converter so that we can use a local spreadsheet in src that will provide all the options for the responses object. This avoids hundreds of lines of code.
The vite.config.ts is what allows me to use this in the project.
