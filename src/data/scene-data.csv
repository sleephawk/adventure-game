As you touch it, the arrow leans, and the telescope follows the same direction. It's like it knew what you were trying to do. Looking through the lense, you see a dark shape block out the rings for a second. It looks like...a giant crow? It must be at least 30ft across!",,,Leave the telescope,10,,,Crow sighting,

You can't help feel a slight shudder, though, as a voice eminates 'what do you wish to do?' You reply 'inputTextHere'.

45,44,"You launch into the darkness and above the rings, surveying for any sign of movement. Before long, you see the edge of a wing in the distance. You have two ways you can do this: try and sneak up on it or attack head on. With stealth, the bird is no stranger to these attempts, so it's likely it'll catch you, but, at the same time, you're without a body and therefore slightly less noticable.

As you approach, you suppose you see a glimmer of fear in his eyes, but, as it rushes towards your face, you know now it is merely the glimmer of your soul about to dissappear into its belly.  You were too defiant, too willing to abandon yourself, and guardian has set it straight. Whatever happens to you now, it will be a long time before you see light again.",,<>,,,,,,
48,46,"Gently, gently, you wrangle a single feather loose. It sails above you like a flag, the bird none the wiser. Before you can change your mind, you're descending upon the ring. The bird notices and follows, but its too late. As the bristles on the feather approach the ring the darkness becomes light, and all dissappears into it. You open your eyes, and look around. You're in your old room, but it feels different. You look down.....still no body. You try to turn on the light, but no luck. You realise then, that it is those who truly cannot accept that one life is over that they are doomed to repeat its echo across time as a lonely ghost. Things could be worse, eh? You drift around your home, since, for now, there's nothing more to be done.",,<>,,,,,,
49,46,"As the feather pops out of the crow's skin, you immediately know you've been too heavy handed. Without hesitation, the great head of the bird rockets towards you and knocks you into space. You feel for a moment you might have been left to the void, but the wings do not relent, beating ever closer until your time is lost to the mouth of the creature. You were too defiant, too willing to abandon yourself, and guardian has set it straight. Whatever happens to you now, it will be a long time before you see light again.",,<>,,,,,,
50,46,"The attempt is valiant, but useless. The crow knows the spirit nature well and far to many restlest souls have attempted to pluck from its coat. Without a second thought, it dives to your location and picks you out of existence, like an earth crow would pick a berry from a tree.",,<>,,,,,,
51,18,"As you approach the sound, it sounds pointed, sharp, like something trying to frighten you. It's so loud it seems to rattle your soul with the vibrations.
